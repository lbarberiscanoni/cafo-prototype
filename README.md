- [ ] Replace svg/png map for National Organization view with a MapContainer, and do the same for the State level
- [ ] Further reponsivize the rest of the pages 
- [ ] Fix up the broken design details
- [ ] On the historical view page, I would also enlarge the icons and add the “Select a Metric” drop-down. If you need me to re-share what should be included in each drop-down, let me know
