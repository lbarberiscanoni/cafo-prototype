- [ ] Zoom the org view to show the dots more 
- [ ] replace dotted lines with solid
- [ ] Add more mock-data for all possible counties
    - there is data for a county at all levels but the state level metrics view is not colored properly
- [ ] Further reponsivize the rest of the pages 
- [ ] Fix up the broken design details
- [ ] On the historical view page, I would also enlarge the icons and add the “Select a Metric” drop-down. If you need me to re-share what should be included in each drop-down, let me know
