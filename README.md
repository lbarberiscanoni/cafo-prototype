- [ ] Add form link to "data missing want to rquest it"
- [ ] on the metrics page we are going to have a "what does this mean" metrics guide
- [ ] Move the embed button to Metrics not Historic Data
- [ ] In the tooltip in the metrics view at the county level, add "source of data" as well 
- [ ] There’s still an issue for anything not mapped to counties (e.g. regions and districts). Here are customizations
    - `Alabama: Date should be displayed for 2022, also in historic data
    Alaska: District
    Connecticut: Region
    DC: Let's create a county page for DC, with the metrics card
    New Hampshire: District
    South Dakota: District Office
    Vermont: District Office
    Washington: Region
    Wisconsin: Date should be displayed for 2022, also in historic data`


[Here are the CAFO Data Sources](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13Bq8yKjXXIynwdoOgY4efEtfI7M72JxQsLBlxl6WTWc/edit?tab=t.0)

Here are the counties/states with active network connections:

**Networks with Connection Lines (2+ orgs):**

| Network | State | County | # Orgs | URL to Test |
|---------|-------|--------|--------|-------------|
| Weld County Collaboration | CO | Weld/Larimer/Arapahoe | 4 | `#/state/colorado/organizational` |
| Okaloosa County Collaboration | FL | Okaloosa | 3 | `#/state/florida/organizational` |
| Kosciusko County Collaboration | IN | Kosciusko | 3 | `#/state/indiana/organizational` |
| Maury County Collaboration | TN | Maury | 2 | `#/state/tennessee/organizational` |
| Highlands County Collaboration | FL | Highlands | 2 | `#/state/florida/organizational` |
| Lowndes County Collaboration | GA | Lowndes | 2 | `#/state/georgia/organizational` |
| York County Collaboration | ME | York | 2 | `#/state/maine/organizational` |
| Upshur County Collaboration | WV | Upshur | 2 | `#/state/west-virginia/organizational` |

**Best for testing:**
- **Colorado** - Weld County Collaboration has 4 orgs spread across 3 counties (most complex)
- **Florida** - Has 2 networks (Okaloosa + Highlands)
- **Indiana** - Kosciusko has 3 orgs all in Warsaw

**Networks with only 1 org (no lines yet):**
- Wake County (NC), Douglas County (NE), Polk County (IA), Clark County (NV)
