- [ ] Church data comes from the county-level MTE data, not AFCARS. So it's not in the national dataset — but it could be aggregated from all the counties, same way the state records aggregate their counties' church counts. 
- [ ] "Your Next Steps" button in TopNav — A new nav item between "Home" and "National Map View" that links to an exit page with CTAs/recommended next steps. She doesn't have the destination URL or page yet — she's going to send that.
- [ ] Caption text on the embed card — A sentence that appears in the iframe footer (to the left of the MTE logo), or if that's not possible, as a caption below the iframe. She's going to send the actual copy via Hive.
- [ ] Add form link to "data missing want to rquest it"
- [ ] on the metrics page we are going to have a "what does this mean" metrics guide






Here are the states that don't have counties (e.g. regions and districts). Here are customizations
    - `Alabama: Date should be displayed for 2022, also in historic data
    - Alaska: District
    - Connecticut: Region
    - DC: Let's create a county page for DC, with the metrics card
    - New Hampshire: District
    - South Dakota: District Office
    - Vermont: District Office
    - Washington: Region
    - Wisconsin: Date should be displayed for 2022, also in historic data`

Here are the counties/states with active network connections:

**Networks with Connection Lines (2+ orgs):**

| Network | State | County | # Orgs | URL to Test |
|---------|-------|--------|--------|-------------|
| Weld County Collaboration | CO | Weld/Larimer/Arapahoe | 4 | `#/state/colorado/organizational` |
| Okaloosa County Collaboration | FL | Okaloosa | 3 | `#/state/florida/organizational` |
| Kosciusko County Collaboration | IN | Kosciusko | 3 | `#/state/indiana/organizational` |
| Maury County Collaboration | TN | Maury | 2 | `#/state/tennessee/organizational` |
| Highlands County Collaboration | FL | Highlands | 2 | `#/state/florida/organizational` |
| Lowndes County Collaboration | GA | Lowndes | 2 | `#/state/georgia/organizational` |
| York County Collaboration | ME | York | 2 | `#/state/maine/organizational` |
| Upshur County Collaboration | WV | Upshur | 2 | `#/state/west-virginia/organizational` |

**Best for testing:**
- **Colorado** - Weld County Collaboration has 4 orgs spread across 3 counties (most complex)
- **Florida** - Has 2 networks (Okaloosa + Highlands)
- **Indiana** - Kosciusko has 3 orgs all in Warsaw

**Networks with only 1 org (no lines yet):**
- Wake County (NC), Douglas County (NE), Polk County (IA), Clark County (NV)
